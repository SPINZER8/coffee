                <h2>Why Coffee is a Developer's Best Friend ☕</h2>
                <p>Coffee isn't just a drink - it's liquid motivation in a cup! The aroma of freshly brewed coffee can stimulate the brain, increasing alertness and focus. In fact, studies show that the smell of coffee can even improve memory and cognitive function.</p>

                <h2>The Magic Formula</h2>
                <p>- 1 cup coffee = 100 bugs fixed: Coffee helps developers stay focused and energized, allowing them to tackle complex coding tasks with ease.</p>
                <p>- 2 cups = 1 feature shipped: With the right amount of caffeine, developers can work efficiently, meeting deadlines and shipping features on time.</p>
                <p>- 3 cups = questioning life choices: As the caffeine starts to wear off, developers may begin to wonder why they chose this career path in the first place.</p>
                <p>- 4+ cups = talking to rubber ducks: At this point, the effects of caffeine can be unpredictable, leading to some...interesting...behavior.</p>

                <h2>Science Behind It</h2>
                <p>Caffeine blocks adenosine receptors in your brain, which normally signal tiredness. This means that sleepy chemicals can't do their job, and you feel more alert and awake.</p>
                <p>But did you know that caffeine can also increase the production of dopamine, a neurotransmitter associated with pleasure and reward? This is why many people experience a sense of euphoria after consuming coffee.</p>

                <h2>The Developer's Dilemma</h2>
                <p>"I'll just fix this one bug" at 2 PM → suddenly it's 2 AM and you've refactored the entire codebase. This is a common phenomenon, especially when working on complex projects with tight deadlines.</p>
                <p>However, consuming coffee after 2 PM can disrupt sleep patterns, leading to a cycle of dependency. It's essential to establish a healthy coffee-drinking routine to avoid this trap.</p>

                <h2>Types of Coffee Drinkers</h2>
                <p>There are three main types of coffee drinkers:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Morning Sipper: Needs coffee to function</li>
                    <li>Afternoon Chugger: Needs coffee to survive meetings</li>
                    <li>Midnight Debugger: Coffee IS their blood type</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Which one are you?</p>

            <section id="pro-tips">
                <h2>Pro Tips</h2>
                <p>Cold brew for marathon coding sessions: This type of coffee is made by steeping coarse-ground coffee beans in cold water for an extended period, resulting in a smooth and full-bodied flavor.</p>
                <p>Espresso for "the build is failing" emergencies: A concentrated shot of coffee, perfect for when you need a quick energy boost to tackle the problem at hand.</p>
                <p>Decaf is just sad water (don't @ me): Let's face it, decaf coffee is just not the same as regular coffee. But hey, if you need a caffeine-free option, go for it!</p>

                <h2>Side Effects May Include</h2>
                <p>Suddenly understanding regex, speaking in binary, and befriending the office printer. Okay, maybe not the last one, but you get the idea!</p>
